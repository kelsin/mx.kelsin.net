After seeing [El Topo](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067866/) recently as part
of the [Frida After
Dark](https://thefridacinema.org/film-series/frida-after-dark-march-2023/)
series I bought most of his films on Blu-ray. I haven't watched the films yet
but I did watch this documentary about his film that was never produced.

### [Jodorowsky's Dune](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1935156/)

The doc does a great job at showing us what he's like as a filmmaker since the
majority of the film is interviews with Jodorowsky himself. While he definitely
needs to learn what the word rape means (and stop using it...), his love for
creating art definitely comes through. What I enjoyed learning about most
however was the group he assembled to make this movie and then seeing examples
of what [they](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0639321/)
[did](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0320786/)
[after](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1134463/).

Def recommended for anyone that would like to see a glimpse at what this movie
would have been like straight from those that were working on it.
