My friend and I wanted to prepare to see [Scream
VI](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17663992/) in a few days so I subscribed to
[Paramount+](https://www.paramountplus.com/home/) in order to watch thr rest of
the series. We watched [Scream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11245972/) tonight
in order to be prepared for the next installment.

### [Scream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11245972/)

I have not seen most of the Scream movies and I only watched the original 20
years ago in college (I feel very old writing that). I'm eager to rewatch I-IV
later today but for now I only remember that it was very meta and referenced a
lot of other horror. It felt like this latest movie (the fifth in the series)
cranks that up to 11.

The meta comedy about the fake "Stab" series that's created in world is great
with a lot of self aware jokes about this movie attempting to revive the
series. I feel like they took the spirit of the original and just ran with it
which is a great direction to run in.

They reference other horror by name a LOT in very self-referential ways. I def
enjoyed the watch and I'm eager to see the sixth. However it also made me want
to watch move "elevated horror" at the same time cause I think I agree with
Jenna's last line: "I still prefer The Babadook."
