So the past few days I've noticed Firefox (Iceweasel actually) being incredibly
slow. I don't know if it's more than it was on Ubuntu or not, but it was
slow. I've also always felt that gtk apps were a bit slow on this machine but
never really bothered to understand why.

Today I got fed up with Firefox and decided to go on a Google hunt and solve the
problem.

* Tried iceweasel (Debian's rebranded Firefox) with -safe-mode. *Nothing*
* Tried iceweasel with a new profile (mv ~/.mozilla ~/.mozilla-old). *Nothing*
* Googled bug reports that told me to change about:config settings. Mainly
  looked like these were for different issues but I tried them anyway.
* Finally I found [this bug](https://bugs.launchpad.net/firefox/+bug/38131
  "Firefox slow bug report") report that mentioned changed some AccelMethod
  lines in xorg. **WORKED**

What worked for me was adding one line to my xorg.conf. The rest is still autoconfigured, I just added the AccelMethod line:

```
Section "Device"
    Identifier "Configured Video Device"
    Option "AccelMethod" "XAA"
EndSection
```

My guess is that this problem comes from Xorg's new autoconfig that's been in
the most recent versions of Debian and Ubuntu. I think that with the intel
driver (i810) it's not able to tell that it should use AccelMethod "XAA". Using
XAA could also be a step back in some different ways. Glxgears STILL only shows
170 fps for me (I know, this is pretty bad, but it's my work machine), but all
GTK apps are so much faster I feel like I'm on a new computer. Xmonad finally
feels super speedy (as it should!)

Again this worked for me, and I have NO idea what else this change means. Try it
at your own risk if you're on a Intel card with a weird, very-slow Firefox.
