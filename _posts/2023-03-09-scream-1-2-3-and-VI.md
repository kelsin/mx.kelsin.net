I watched [Scream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/), [Scream
2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120082/), and [Scream
3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084/) today before going to see [Scream
VI](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17663992/). Hopefully I'll get to watch [Scream
4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262416/) tomorrow!

### [Scream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117571/)

Classic. Probably the best intro sequence to all of the films (with Jenna
Ortega's in [Scream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11245972/) a close
second). Love the campy jokes and the setup for the rest of the
films. Definitely a recommend for anyone that likes slashers.

### [Scream 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120082/)

This clearly continues the meta-horror commentary that the first movie had. I
enjoyed it and the performances and the sequal jokes. I can't imagine that
anyone who enjoyed the first movie would not enjoy this one. Definitely lays out
more elements that will appear in later films (Stab, etc).

Lots of people getting shot and stabbed that end up living which is
interesting. I didn't like the random people getting killed in the beginning at
the movie theater, that felt a bit off the mark compared to the other intros in
the series.

### [Scream 3](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134084/)

I definitely didn't end up caring at all about Cotton dying, so the intro was a
bit... boring. I like the continuation of the "Stab" in-movie movie franchise.

Parker Posie was a very pleasent surprise. I'm excited to see more of her [this
month](https://thefridacinema.org/film-series/parker-posey-month-march-2023/) at
the Frida Cinema as well! The Jay and Silent Bob cameo was also welcome. The
Carrie Fisher cameo was also incredible.

### [Scream VI](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17663992/)

So just left the threater after watching this. Great (and funny) intro with
Samara Weaving. Nice meta references (Argento is mentioned!) and great horror
references in a lot of the costumes that people are wearing during the
movie. Nice motives in the end and great performances again from Melissa Barrera
and Jenna Ortega (no surprises there based on the 5th movie).

It was a great time at the threater, I was laughing a lot and the kills were
great. I really like this group of friends a lot and they all have great
chemistry on screen. It's exactly what I hoped the 6th Scream movie would be!
