In preperation for watching [Creed III](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11145118/)
I have recently watched [all](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075148/)
[of](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079817/)
[the](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084602/)
[Rocky](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089927/)
[movies](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0100507/) including [Rocky
Balboa](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0479143/). Today I watched
[Creed](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3076658/) and [Creed
II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6343314/).

### [Creed](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3076658/)

So far through my Rocky movie trip I've just enjoyed spending time with
Rocky. This movie gives me that. Adonis winning Rocky over is predictable as you
can imagine. The plot lines are enjoyable despite this and my main worry is that
these movies without Stallone won't be as enjoyable.

Having Adonis not win his fight is a nice throwback to the original. I really
enjoyed Tessa Thompson's performance. Stallone is still great at playing a
character that he obviously loves.

### [Creed II](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6343314/)

Very interesting how this contains a bunch of the plot points from Rocky II and
IV. I enjoyed this one more than the first only due to all of the callbacks to
the original movies.

Rocky movies always had a lot of heart, and they are heavily leaning into that
with this movie. There's this great shot of Tessa soon after having their baby
where she's sleeping in the hospital bed with her arm over her baby. Very
realistic and nice to see. Rocky shares some great parenting advice throughout
which I also enjoyed (I'm a sap).

So all in all, Creed II felt like a worthy Rocky movie to me. I still like Rocky
more than any other character.
