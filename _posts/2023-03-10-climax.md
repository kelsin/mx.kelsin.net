As part of the [21st Century
Cult](https://thefridacinema.org/film-series/21st-century-cult-january-2023/)
series at the [Frida Cinema](https://thefridacinema.org/) I was able to catch
Gaspar No√©'s [Climax](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8359848/) tonight. I have not
managed to see [Irreversible](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0290673/) yet but
next time it plays locally I'm going to try and make it.

### [Climax](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8359848/)

This one was a tough watch. I tend to not like drug sequences in movies and the
second half of this one is basically just a long drug sequence. Kept me
entertained the entire time and luckily it did show you the end result of most
of the characters. A lot of it was tough to watch, characters all respond to the
drugs they've ingested differently and most of it isn't good.

I love the dancing and the camera work throughout. I really liked the main
performance from Sofia Boutella. The long shots work really well and draw you
into the action. However this isn't one I'm likely to return to at any point due
to the tough nature of some of the scenes.
