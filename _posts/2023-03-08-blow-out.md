I've made a bunch of orders from [The Criterion
Collection](https://www.criterion.com/) recently and I went a little overboard
with one order. I ordered a bunch of movies I've never seen just based on them
having 4k UHD Criterion releases. One of those was Brian De Palma's [Blow
Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/).

### [Blow Out](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/)

This film was interesting. I'm normally pretty bored by 70's and 80's
pictures. I don't tend to have any context yet about what was done before and
what hasn't been done yet and that tends to cloud my opinions. What I did enjoy
on this one was the camera work and focus on the main characters job as a sound
engineer.

One sequence in particular during the middle right after Jack get's his tapes
wiped where he's going around his studio checking all of his tapes was
great. The camera is placed in the middle of the room and swirls around numerous
times while John Travolta's character is realizing how much damage was
done. It's very effective and definitately reminded me of a lot of my stress
dreams.

Recommended for De Palma fans and Thriller fans.
