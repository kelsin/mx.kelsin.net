It's coming after already seeing [Scream
VI](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt17663992/) but today I watched [Scream
4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262416/) completeing the full series!

### [Scream 4](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1262416/)

The new cast isn't used as well as they should be, I wasnted to see more of them
which I didn't really get until the final act. The screen time and plot between
the original cast and the new cast is not handled as nicely as in 5 and 6 but
better than 3.

The normal meta comedy is in full effect and if I liked the killers it would be
more effective. The writers couldn't figure out how to keep pulling Sidney back
into the plot effectively. I actually liked the killers at the end of 4, they
grew on me and the motives ended up being a lot better than 2 and 3.

I think one pulls in front of 2 and 3 for me. I think this is due to the cast,
the right meta comedy for me and the killers and motives. My final ranking: VI,
(5), 1, 4, 2, and 3. I really didn't enjoy some of the things they tried in 3
which they clearly corrected in all movies since. The strength of the new cast
keeps VI and the fifth ahead of the original for me. I'm probably also biased
due to liking the current references since I largely got into horror in the past
two years. The next time a Scream movie comes out I'll probably rewatch the
fifth and VI only unless it clearly ties into one of the other ones.
