I recently joined the [film club](https://thefridacinema.org/film-club/) at my
local [Frida Cinema](https://thefridacinema.org/) and I would like to start
blogging my experiences at seeing different movies. Last night I was [The
Outwaters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13259610/) so might as well start!

### [The Outwaters](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13259610/)

This movie was definitely an experience. Overall I didn't get what I wanted out
of this movie. In general I don't tend to enjoy found footage due to the shaky
cameras. One of my favorite things about film is camera work and crafted scenes
and angles and I tend to not see that (at least in the found footage films that
I've seen).

I loved the out-of-this-world-lovecraftian elements but I wish they paid off a
bit more. I also didn't get enough pay off for the hour of character development
that happens prior to the crazy stuff. You do really get to know some of these
characters, but I don't think any of that knowledge gets used once things go
wild.

I doubt I would seek it out to see it again.
