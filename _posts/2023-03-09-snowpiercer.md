While waiting for a friend to arrive in order to watch
[Scream](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11245972/) I decided to see what else
[Paramount+](https://www.paramountplus.com/home/) had available and decided to
rewatch [Snowpiercer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/)

### [Snowpiercer](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1706620/)

I tend to enjoy shows and movies that have a big constraint on location and
setting. This movie entirely taking place on a futuristic train that houses all
that remains of humanity is a great setup. We all know that Bong Joon Ho went on
to make [Parasite](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6751668/) and you can already
see his knack for reveals and suspense. His payoffs at the end of both films are
really satisfying and the writing is truly great in both.

There's a lot I feel like I'm missing in Snowpiercer but I'm not sure I'm going
to rewatch this film enough times to understand it all. Watching it post 2020
definitly brings up different feelings than my last watch. My belief that
humanity wouldn't go along with horrible events has been shattered and this
movie plays into that a bit.

Totally recommended for everyone at some point. Great film with good
performances, great writing and a really great (and unique) sci-fi setting.
