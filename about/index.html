      <h2>Board Games</h2>
      <p>
        My main hobby outside of work is collecting board games. I'm particularly a fan of the 18xx
        family of games and games with heavy economic systems. You can check out
        <a href="https://bit.ly/kelsin-boardgames">my board game collection</a> on BoardGameGeek.

      <h2>Video Games</h2>
      <p>
        I tend to play a few games for a long time (very different from my wife's
        habbits). I've always been a very big fan of Blizzard games and have been
        playing them for most of my life. I can also be found on League of Legends
        (I've spent far too much money on League!)
